# SmartContainer Risk Engine

**AI/ML Container Inspection Prioritisation System**  
XGBoost · Flask REST API · React Dashboard · Docker-ready

## 1. Problem Understanding

Ports process thousands of containers daily. Traditional rule-based screening:
- Misses hidden irregularities that don't fit static rules
- Generates unnecessary inspections (false positives drain resources)
- Fails to adapt as trade patterns shift over time

**This system** replaces static rules with a trained ML model that learns historical risk patterns and scores every incoming container 0–100 in real time — giving port officers a ranked, explainable inspection queue.

**Dataset:** 45,519 historical shipments (Jan–Sep 2020) across 93 origin countries, 2,438 HS codes, 13,676 unique importers.  
**Class distribution:** Critical 1.04% · Low Risk 20.5% · Clear 78.4% — heavily imbalanced, requiring explicit handling.

## 2. Approach and Methodology

### Pipeline Overview

```
Historical CSV
      │
      ▼
 Train/Val Split (80/20, stratified)   ← split BEFORE encoding to prevent leakage
      │
      ├─► Train fold → compute_encoding_maps()  ← risk rates derived here only
      │
      ├─► build_features(train, enc_maps)
      ├─► build_features(val,   enc_maps)        ← val uses train-derived maps only
      │
      ▼
 XGBoost (multi:softprob, 600 trees, early stopping)
      │
      ▼
 Hybrid Risk Score (0–100) + Risk Level + Explanation
```

### Leakage Prevention
Encoding maps (importer risk scores, HS code risk rates, exporter risk scores, etc.) are computed **exclusively on the training fold**. Validation rows are encoded using maps that have never seen their labels — matching real-world deployment where the model has no knowledge of incoming shipment outcomes.

### Class Imbalance Handling
Per-sample weights inversely proportional to class frequency. Critical containers receive ~78× the weight of Clear containers, forcing the model to prioritise recall on the rare but high-stakes class.

### Hybrid Risk Score
Raw XGBoost probabilities collapse near 0 or 1 at high accuracy. A 6-component weighted composite prevents binary score clustering:

| Component | Weight | Signal |
|---|---|---|
| Model log-odds | 40% | Stretched ML probability |
| Weight mismatch | 20% | Declared vs measured kg diff |
| Value anomaly | 15% | Value z-score + zero-value flag |
| Dwell time | 10% | Excess port dwell |
| Entity risk | 10% | Origin + importer historical rate |
| Composite anomaly | 5% | Count of triggered anomaly flags |

## 3. Model Design

### Feature Engineering (16 features)

| # | Feature | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `weight_diff_pct` | % difference between declared and measured weight |
| 2 | `weight_diff_abs` | Absolute kg difference |
| 3 | `value_per_kg` | Declared value ÷ weight (detects high-value smuggling) |
| 4 | `value_zscore` | Declared value deviation from batch mean |
| 5 | `dwell_zscore` | Dwell time deviation from batch mean |
| 6 | `Dwell_Time_Hours` | Raw dwell time (Critical avg: 88.7h vs Clear: 40.5h) |
| 7 | `is_night_declaration` | Declared 10pm–5am (33% of all shipments) |
| 8 | `is_weekend` | Declared on Saturday/Sunday |
| 9 | `origin_risk_score` | Historical Critical rate by origin country |
| 10 | `importer_risk_score` | Historical Critical rate by importer ID |
| 11 | `exporter_risk_score` | Historical Critical rate by exporter ID (NEW) |
| 12 | `shipping_line_risk_score` | Historical Critical rate by shipping line (NEW) |
| 13 | `hs_code_risk_score` | Historical Critical rate by HS code |
| 14 | `hs_code_frequency` | HS code rarity (rare codes = more suspicious) |
| 15 | `is_transit` | Trade regime = Transit flag |
| 16 | `anomaly_score` | Composite count of triggered anomaly flags (0–6) |

All entity risk scores use **IQR-based thresholds** from training data only. Unseen entities fall back to the overall historical Critical rate (~1.04%).

### XGBoost Configuration

```
objective       : multi:softprob (3 classes)
n_estimators    : 600 (with early stopping, rounds=30)
max_depth       : 6
learning_rate   : 0.05
subsample       : 0.8
colsample_bytree: 0.8
min_child_weight: 5
reg_alpha/lambda: 0.1 / 1.0  (L1 + L2 regularisation)
```

### Anomaly Detection (Rule-based, independent of ML)

Six anomaly flags, each contributing +1 to composite score (0–6):
- Weight mismatch > IQR threshold (~9.4%)
- Dwell time > IQR threshold (~100h)
- Value/kg > 95th percentile
- Night-time declaration
- Zero declared value
- Exporter flagged as high-risk (historical rate > 5%)

**Anomaly_Flag = 1** when composite score ≥ 2. Fully auditable, no ML dependency.

### Explainability

Every container receives a 1–3 line plain-English explanation:
```
Weight mismatch 24.3% exceeds threshold 9.4%. Exporter X3K9P2 has elevated 
Critical shipment history. High-risk origin country (CN).
```
Every sentence maps to a specific, verifiable condition — no black-box reasoning.

## 4. Key Findings and Insights

**Dwell time is the strongest operational signal**  
Critical containers dwell an average of **88.7 hours** vs 40.5 hours for Clear (2.2× difference). Containers exceeding ~100h have a 14× elevated inspection rate.

**Weight mismatch is highly discriminatory**  
Containers with >15% weight discrepancy (5.3% of shipments) have a **14.0% Critical rate** — 13.5× the baseline rate.

**Exporter identity is underutilised in traditional systems**  
297 exporters have >10% historical Critical rate. 83.1% of real-time exporters appear in historical data, making this a reliable signal.

**Geographic concentration**  
CN accounts for 50.9% of shipments and 65.9% of Critical cases. DE has the highest Critical rate among high-volume origins at 1.8%.

**HS code patterns reveal commodity risk**  
6 HS codes have a 100% historical Critical rate. 10 codes exceed 50% — these commodity types warrant automatic elevated scrutiny regardless of other signals.

**Night declarations: weaker than expected**  
33.3% of all shipments are declared at night, but the Critical rate is actually *lower* at night (0.96% vs 1.07% daytime). The model correctly assigns low weight to this feature.
